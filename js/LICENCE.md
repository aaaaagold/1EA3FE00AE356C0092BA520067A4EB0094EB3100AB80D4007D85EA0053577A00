In this directory, codes are contained in the game engine. Although I made some changes for conveniently editing, most of them are from
https://store.steampowered.com/app/363890/RPG_Maker_MV/

As they are sold there, if you want to use their codes, at least buy that product,
or, if they permit obtaining codes from others, then I think it should be fine.
